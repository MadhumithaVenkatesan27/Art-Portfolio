          <h2>Art from Heart</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I'm so happy you're here. Pretty Stories is my cozy
            little space where I share the things I love most: mandala art,
            painting, journaling, crafts, and heartfelt stories expressed
            through colors and patterns. If you’re someone who finds magic in
            colors, comfort in words, or a spark of peace in quiet moments,
            everything here is crafted with soul to inspire your creative
            journey.

            <li>
              <h3>Mandala Art</h3>
              <p>
                Come explore the world of mandalas, where every design is a
                personal journey filled with balance and creativity. Through
                detailed patterns and vibrant colors, my art expresses peace,
                mindfulness, and a sense of calm. I hope it encourages you to
                follow your own creative path.

              <h3>Painting</h3>
              <p>
                Painting is where colors come alive and emotions take shape.
                Whether I’m working with soft watercolors or bold acrylics, each
                brushstroke is a step in telling a story or capturing a feeling.
                It’s a joyful, sometimes meditative process that lets me explore
                light, texture, and mood. Join me as I experiment and share the
                colorful moments that inspire my art.

              <h3>Journaling</h3>
              <p>
                Journaling is one of my favorite ways to reflect and express
                myself. I love creating quote stickers that bring a touch of
                inspiration to every page. Here, I share simple layout ideas,
                thoughtful prompts, and creative ways to use writing for
                personal growth. It's a space where your thoughts can flow
                freely and beautifully.

              <h3>Craft & DIY</h3>
              <p>
                Art and craft are at the heart of what I do. From drawing to DIY
                projects, I love experimenting with different materials and
                styles. Whether you're looking for new ideas or want to dive
                into some creative projects, you’ll find something to spark your
                imagination.

              <h3>Stories & Inspiration</h3>
              <p>
                Every piece of art carries a story, and I’m excited to share
                mine with you in both words and voice. Through written stories
                and heartfelt voiceovers, I dive into the moments, ideas, and
                experiences that inspire my creativity. I hope these stories
                spark your own passion and encourage you to express yourself
                through art and beyond.
